## 📌 Core Java (Fundamentals)

- [ ] OOP Concepts (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation)
- [ ] Interfaces and Abstract Classes
- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Exception Handling (try/catch, throw, finally)

- [ ] Wrapper Classes & Autoboxing
- [ ] Access Modifiers (private, protected, public)
- [ ] Generics (List<T>, Map<K,V>)
- [ ] Static, Final, Transient, Volatile

---

## 🌊 Intermediate Java (Backend-Oriented)

- [ ] Java 8 Streams API (filter, map, reduce)
- [ ] Lambda Expressions
- [ ] Functional Interfaces (Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier)
- [ ] Optional Class
- [ ] Date & Time API (LocalDate, LocalDateTime, Period)
- [ ] Immutable Objects
- [ ] StringBuilder / StringBuffer
- [ ] String manipulation methods (join, replaceAll, matches)

---

## ⚙️ Advanced Java

- [ ] Multithreading & Concurrency Basics
- [ ] ExecutorService / ThreadPool
- [ ] Synchronized, volatile, locks
- [ ] Custom Annotations
- [ ] Reflection API
- [ ] ClassLoader Basics
- [ ] Parallel Streams

---

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging

- [ ] Java Assertions
- [ ] JUnit 5 Basics
- [ ] Mockito Basics (mock, spy, verify)
- [ ] try-with-resources

---

## 🧱 Java 9+ Features

- [ ] Java Modules (Java 9)
- [ ] var keyword (Java 10)
- [ ] Records (Java 14+)
- [ ] Text Blocks (Java 15)
- [ ] Pattern Matching for instanceof (Java 16+)

---

## 🛠 Utility Libraries

- [ ] Apache Commons Lang, IO
- [ ] Google Guava
- [ ] Lombok
- [ ] MapStruct or ModelMapper
- [ ] Jackson Annotations (@JsonIgnore, @JsonProperty, etc.)

---

## 📘 Bonus Topics

- [ ] Serialization & Deserialization (JSON, Binary)
- [ ] Custom JSON Serializers/Deserializers
- [ ] Bidirectional relationship handling in JPA
- [ ] Asynchronous Programming (@Async, CompletableFuture)
- [ ] File I/O and Resource Management
- [ ] Java Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder, etc.)
- [ ] Java Performance Optimization (Profiling, GC tuning)
- [ ] Java Testing Ecosystem (TestContainers, AssertJ)

---

## ✅ Tips

- Practice building full-stack apps with DTOs, layered architecture, and exception handling.
- Avoid exposing entities directly in APIs — always use DTOs.
- Use `@ControllerAdvice` for global exception handling.
- Dockerize your apps and deploy to cloud (Heroku, AWS, etc.).
